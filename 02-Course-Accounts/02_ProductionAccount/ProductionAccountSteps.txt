It's time for a [DOITYOURSELF] lesson.

So far, I have demonstrated how to create and configure the GENERAL AWS account.

Now, you need to follow the same steps to create a PRODUCTION AWS account.

Create the AWS account named similar to your general account -PRODUCTION
Add MFA to the account root user
Enable billing access for IAM users and set account contacts
Add a billing ALARM to the PRODUCTION AWS Account.
If in doubt - follow the previous videos, but replace 'GENERAL' with 'PRODUCTION'
